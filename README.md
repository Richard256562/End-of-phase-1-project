WEATHER APPLICATION


AUTHOR:
Richard Okongo

HOW IT WORKS

My Project works through the use of an API that works on any browser. I use this API to acquire the images that will be used as background images for the weather app.API obtained from "https://openweathermap.org"
The weather app usese geoloaction and works to find out :
. weather
. windspeed
. humidity
. the temperature of various cities around the world.
Once you input a city in the seaarch box it instantly returns the above while also providing a background image of something related to the city for aesthetics.
